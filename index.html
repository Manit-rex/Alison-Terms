                <h3>1. Our commitment</h3>

                <p>
                    Capernaum Limited trades as “Alison”, and is located in Galway, Ireland.  
                    Alison respects User’s rights regarding their privacy and information, taking great care with any personally identifying information.  
                    As an Irish domiciled entity, the Alison platform is subject to the laws of Ireland and regulations of the E.U. 
                    The General Data Protection Regulation (effective from May 2018) and Data Protection Acts 1988-2018 in Ireland apply to the safeguarding and processing of 
                    personal data that could be used to identify any citizens of the E.U.. Alison is committed
                    to complying with its legal obligations in this regard, not just to data subjects (Users) in the E.U. but to extend the same 
                    courtesy to all Alison Users worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policy is based on obligations created through General Data Protection Regulation in 
                    the E.U. and other equivalent legislation worldwide such as the California Consumer Privacy
                     Act in the US.

                <h3>2. Collection, processing and storage of data</h3>
                <p>
                    The Alison platform may collect and process personal data relating to past and present 
                    users and learners in the course of business. Alison collects data directly from the User 
                    input but also in automated ways such as through system logs, cookies, web beacons and
                    integration with third party service providers.  Processing of data includes: collecting; 
                    recording; storing; altering; disclosing; destroying; and blocking. This policy governs 
                    Alison’s approach to data and does not apply to any third party organisations which may 
                    have integrated their systems to the Alison platform.

                <h3>3. Personally Identifying Information (PII)</h3>
                <p>
                    Personally Identifying Information (PII) may be required to uniquely identify a User upon 
                    Registration (e.g. a personal email address) and other information may be required to complete
                    purchases and receive certification if requested.  You may also be invited to create a personal
                    profile and resumé (including date of birth, existing education, work experience and career ambitions) 
                    and to generate or supply other personal information (such as completing personality, psychometric and 
                    workplace assessments) to build out your profile to determine your suitability for different careers, 
                    job opportunities and to establish your own tailored learning pathway.  You will have the option to share or unshared 
                    some or all of this information in your own public profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal data is stored within your User account on the platform and access is completely restricted via 
                    encrypted networks and access permissions in order to ensure the highest levels of confidentiality and protection.  
                    No personal data is available to download or remove from the platform by employees or third parties, and Alison ensures that 
                    only authorised personnel have online access to a User’s account data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users may decide to post comments on the Alison Blog or interact with other Users in a way 
                    which is public or widely available to Alison Users through postings, sharing, course reviews,
                    direct communications, giving testimonials, uploading photos or commenting on different parts of 
                    the Alison platform (“Shared Content” or “Public Posting”).  Alison will collect and store Public 
                    Postings and Shared Content which will become publicly available or viewable by others.  When you 
                    share content or make a public posting you are consenting to granting Alison a non-exclusive right
                    and license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, offer, market and otherwise use and exploit the 
                    Public Postings and Shared Content. However Alison is not responsible for how other Users may use such 
                    publicly available information or otherwise accessible to others who have access to the Services. Users are expected 
                    to use their discretion when making such posts. In the event that a User is selected as "Learner of the Day" or "Learner of the Month",
                    the User agrees to allow Alison to publish their Registration Information (except for your email address),
                    Profile Information, and Course Information as well as your response to the accolade for marketing purposes and/or 
                    via Alison Services.

                <h3>4. Course information</h3>
                <p>
                    After registration, a User can enroll in a course offered by Alison or its affiliated Publishers.  Aggregated data on age, gender (where available) and country of origin is shared with 
                    affiliated Publishers relating to the Users enrolled on the courses they teach, and is subject to a legal agreement between Alison and each individual Publisher. 
                    There is no way for a Publisher to access or derive User level information from this aggregated information.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alison processes certain data relevant to the publication and playback of course content by publishers and learners. Certain data is collected to ensure Users, publishers and learner
                    progress are uniquely identified and accurate records are maintained in order to deliver the Alison learning service and  to comply with relevant legal obligations.  This will include regular emails to keep Users 
                    informed of their progress and make various suggestions and recommendations. Patterns of usage behaviour and course content evaluation is also collected and stored as metadata to help Alison 
                    and Publishers improve the services and offer the most appropriate content and courses to registered Users.

                <h3>5. Third-party information processors and service providers</h3>
                <p>
                    All User personal data is stored securely on third party cloud-based electronic storage and safeguarded. User purchases of physical goods 
                    require a home delivery address to process orders. Alison uses payment processing and fulfilment partners who will receive sensitive PII to enable payment collection and when necessary, physical fulfilment. Highly sensitive data, such as credit card information and passwords are never received by Alison (e.g. when you allow third party authentication via 
                    your social media sign-on, or by choosing third party payment providers such as Paypal or Stripe, that isolate Alison from your payment details). Recurring payment details are stored by a third party payment provider that you choose and not by Alison.  Although Alison allows 
                    Users to register with their social media single sign-on (such as Facebook, Google, Linked-in etc.) the information available on these third party platforms is governed by their terms and information sharing practices. Alison only takes necessary information from these social platforms (i.e. your name, email address, and country for legitimate purposes) and does NOT take any 
                    other personal or social information on your friends and contacts from these platforms.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alison tests and operates a number of analytical tags, scripts and tracking pixels (also known as web beacons) from third party providers such as Google, Facebook, Bing, and Hotjar) to enable browser and mobile 
                    analytics that measure page views and sessions. This helps Alison understand 
                    User behaviours as the visit, navigate and leave the Alison platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alison provides free learning supported through advertising services managed by third parties.  Alison both buys online ads and sells online ads through third party providers (e.g. Google AdWords, Bing, Facebook Ads and Google AdSense).
                    Cookies and tracking pixels are used by advertising service providers as independent third party data controllers to enable personalised
                    advertising to the User based on intent, search history and demographics built up by advertising service providers over time. Alison has no access to these third party cookies or tracking technology nor any control over how third party 
                    advertising service providers use the data they collect.

                <h3>6. Technical data Collection</h3>
                <p>
                    As an internet based service, web server log files are also collected and monitored for usage and behaviour patterns over time. User device information and IP addresses are also 
                    collected to understand platform traffic flows how each User interacts with Alison Services and to ensure the right balance of 
                    technical support, customer service resources and device expertise is available to Users
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alison also stores and uses cookie information (a piece of text saved on each User’s device) to help track unique user sessions, to personalise Alison Services for the User.  
                    Alison stores Preference, Security, Functional and Session cookies to tailor the usage experience, securely automate User login and enable purchase transactions. 
                    Alison uses web beacons to help monitor email communications with our registered Users to understand which messages are successfully delivered and read.

                    personally identifiable information when you delete your account.  You may modify your email client, browser settings or use browser add-ons to control how cookies, beacons and other third party services work.  Privacy settings
                     are also provided on your mobile device operating system to give you more control over your data.  Reducing the level of data shared and advertising options may reduce the quality of, or disable, some or all Alison services.

                <p>
                    Alison recognises the privacy interests of children. Parents and guardians need to take an active role in 
                    their children's online activities and interests. Digital consent is generally not legally recognised for 
                    children under the age of 13, or under the age of 16 where such children reside in the European Economic 
                    Area. Parents and legal guardians should not allow their children defined as such to register, enrol and 
                    learn on the Alison platform without full time supervision. Alison reserves the right to delete any User 
                    account that we discover was created by a child unable to give digital consent. If a parent or guardian 
                    discovers that Alison has unlawfully collected the personal information from a child please contact our 
                    data protection officers who will take all reasonable steps to delete such information promptly.

                <h3>8. Retension of data</h3>
                <p>
                    Alison is under a legal obligation to keep certain data for a specified period of time. Furthermore Alison aggregates data and anonymises 
                    User accounts that are deleted so that it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person. Such Other Information is used by Alison for other relevant business purposes for as long as necessary. 
                    This may include keeping Other Information after the User has deleted their account for whatever period of time needed for Alison to pursue its legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply 
                    with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce commercial agreements.

                <h3>9. Security and disclosure of data</h3>
                <p>
                    The organisation will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect the confidentiality of electronically stored data. The platform is large and public and subject to regular attack by hackers.  
                    The platform has been hardened extensively over time however no online system is perfect or immune from breach. Alison has appropriate
                     security measures in place to protect against unauthorised access. 
                    Safeguards are applied to the processing and retention of data. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limitations on access to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration, disclosure, or erasure of personal data.</li>
                    <li>Strict time limits for erasure of personal data in line with our retention policy.</li>
                    <li>Logging mechanisms to permit verification of whether and by whom personal data has been consulted, altered, disclosed, or erased.</li>
                    <li>Pseudonymisation, anonymisation, and encryption.</li>
                    <li>
                        The platform databases are not accessible directly by employees or software developers other than 
                        authorised DevOps administrators. Multi-factor authentication is required for all authorised DevOps 
                        administrators to ensure access to sensitive data is restricted to the maximum possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security measures will be reviewed from time to time, having regard to the technology available, the 
                        cost, and the risk of unauthorised access.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Customer Support employees will have access to a certain amount of personal data relating to users and 
                    other third parties. Employees must not disclose Users' personal data, except where necessary in the 
                    course of their employment or in accordance with the law. They must not remove or destroy personal data 
                    except for lawful reasons and with the permission of the organisation. Any breach of the data protection 
                    principles is a serious matter and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. 
                    All Alison employees must adhere to the following data protection principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Process data fairly, lawfully, and transparently.</li>
                    <li>Keep data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.</li>
                    <li>Process data only in ways which are compatible with the purposes for which it was given.</li>
                    <li>Ensure data is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
                    <li>Ensure data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose for which it was given.</li>
                    <li>Keep data safely and securely.</li>
                    <li>Retain personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed and in line with the company’s data retention policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Users have an obligation to keep their User account credential sufficiently strong, protected for safe-keeping and 
                    private to themselves to prevent unauthorised access. Users must monitor and control all activity on their account.  If you suspect a breach of your account please change your password 
                    immediately and contact Alison customer support so that the impact can be minimised. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Were a data breach to occur and if such a breach puts individuals’ personal rights and freedoms at risk and Alison is unable to contain those risks, 
                    all affected individuals will be notified expeditiously.  Furthermore Alison’s data protection officers will inform the 
                    Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland so that they are aware and can monitor the response.

                <p>
                    The directors of the company are ultimately responsible for your data, and have nominated a named Data Protection Officer for Alison (“DPO”). The DPO is are responsible for assisting the organisation in 
                    monitoring and maintaining compliance with data protection legislation. 
                </p>

                <h3>11. Access requests</h3>
                <p>
                    Users across the world may have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, 
                    you may have the right to request access to Information, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct this Information.  Your Alison User Account 
                    provides the settings and self-service tools needed for these requests.  Please contact Alison Customer Services if you wish to get a complete copy of all your electronic data held about you as a User.  If a User opts to delete their User account, 
                    Alison will delete all PII, Profile and Resumé data, and will irreversibly anonymise their learner record. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no charge to use Alison’s User account self-service tools.  However the company reserves the right to charge a fee to process any further 
                    Subject Access Request. The organisation will, in most circumstances, provide this data within one month. In some cases, due to the complexity of the request or the number of requests being handled by the 
                    organisation, the organisation may require a further two months to provide this data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are only entitled to access data about themselves and will not be provided with data relating to other users or third parties.  However some user data may have been disclosed publicly on Alison forums for example.  
                    It may be possible to block out User data relating to a third party or conceal the User’s identity, and where this is possible the organisation will endeavour to do so.  A user who is dissatisfied with the outcome of an access 
                    request has the option of referring a complaint to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland.

            <h3>12. Right to object</h3>
            <p>
                Users may have the right to object to data processing that is causing them distress and/or to make corrections to personal data which is inaccurate. Where such objection is justified, the organisation will cease processing the data 
                unless it has a legitimate interest that prevents this. Alison will make every effort to alleviate the distress caused to the individual. An objection should be made in writing to 
                the Data Protection Officer, outlining the data in question and the harm being caused.

                <h3>13. International transmission of data</h3>
                <p>
                    Based in the Republic of Ireland, Alison operates on a global basis and it may be necessary in the course of business to collect or transfer User personal data across state boundaries, to share data with other group companies 
                    in countries outside the European Economic Area, and to share information with third party service providers.  The transfer of such data is deemed necessary for the management and administration of your User Account and delivery of Alison Services. Some 
                    states do not have comparable data protection laws to Ireland or the EU.  When data transfer is necessary, Alison will take steps to ensure that the data has an equal level of protection as it would in Ireland or as expected within other leading international
                     jurisdictions. Furthermore Alison will only transmit data to companies that agree to guarantee the same level of protection. For more information, please contact Alison’s Data Protection Officers.

                <h3>14. Policy review and modification</h3>
                <p>
                    Alison has completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment and put the necessary policy and procedures in place to minimise risks to users data privacy and maximise data protection. This policy will be reviewed from time to time to take into account changes in the law and the experience of the policy in practice. Updates will be posted to the website when available. Material updates will be circulated to each User via the registered User email on the User Account. Continued
                    usage of the Alison Service is deemed to be User acceptance of this policy as permitted by applicable law.

            <h2>Alison Cookies Policy</h2>
            <h4>Effective Date: May 17,2018</h4>
            <h4>What are cookies?</h4>


            <p>Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you browse the Internet.
                Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across 
                websites and services, including on Alison. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to 
                Alison, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier 
                for you to use.

                Alison uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular
                visit to Alison. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using 
                Alison. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into Alison. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer
                period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.</p>

                <h4 style="color: silver;">Why does Alison use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>
                <p>Alison uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, browser cookies, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use cookies both when you access our site and services on a browser, as well as through our native mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

                </p>
                <h3>We use cookies for the following purposes:</h3>

                        and</li>
                    <li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Alison’s agreements and terms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Alison and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts</h4>
                <h4>Preferences:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences;

                    <li>To remember your settings and other choices you have made.</li>    
                </ul>
                <h4>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Alison.</h4>
                
                <h4><strong>Analytics and research:</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To help us improve and understand how people use Alison.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of Alison to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Alison by using cookies to see how you interact with Alison, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.</p>
                <p>To help us better understand how people use Alison, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. 
                    These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party 
                    Services from which you arrive. The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Alison.

In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
